# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a **Vector Database Learning Repository** designed as an educational resource for mastering vector databases from zero to hero. The repository contains structured learning materials, roadmaps, and progressive exercises for understanding and implementing vector database concepts.

## Key Files and Structure

- **`VECTOR_DB_HERO_ROADMAP.md`** - The main learning path with 5 progressive quests (beginner to expert)
- **`roadMap.md`** - Original comprehensive roadmap with multiple approaches and detailed examples
- **`SIDE_MISSIONS.md`** - Skill development roadmap for AI/ML engineering capabilities 
- **`Readme.md`** - Simple project description

## Development Context

This is primarily a **documentation and learning materials repository** rather than a traditional codebase. The focus is on:

1. **Educational Content Creation** - Progressive learning exercises that build upon each other
2. **Code Examples** - Embedded Python code snippets demonstrating vector database concepts
3. **Learning Path Design** - Structured progression from basic concepts to production systems

## Working with This Repository

### Environment Setup
- **Virtual Environment**: `venv/` directory contains isolated Python environment
- **Quick Start**: Run `python quick_start.py` to test basic setup
- **Status Check**: Run `python check_env.py` to see package installation status
- **Installation**: See `INSTALL.md` for detailed setup instructions

### Content Development
- **Exercise Creation**: Each exercise should build incrementally on previous knowledge
- **Code Examples**: All code snippets should be runnable and educational
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Maintain clear skill progression (Quest 1 â†’ Quest 5)

### Technologies Covered
The learning materials focus on:
- **ChromaDB** - Primary vector database for beginners
- **FAISS** - Performance optimization and indexing
- **Sentence Transformers** - Text embeddings
- **CLIP** - Multimodal embeddings
- **OpenAI/LLM APIs** - RAG system integration
- **Python Libraries**: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, torch

### Educational Philosophy
- **Hands-on Learning** - Every concept is immediately applied in code
- **Gamification** - Quest-based progression with achievement tiers
- **Real-world Applications** - Practical scenarios (movie recommendations, news search, etc.)
- **Technical Depth** - No shortcuts on fundamentals while maintaining engagement

## Content Guidelines

### Exercise Structure
Each exercise should include:
1. **Clear Objective** - What specific concept is being learned
2. **Prerequisites** - What previous knowledge is required
3. **Runnable Code** - Complete, executable examples
4. **Completion Requirements** - Bronze/Silver/Gold/Legendary tiers
5. **Progressive Complexity** - Building on previous exercises

### Code Quality Standards
- All Python code should be complete and runnable
- Include necessary imports and setup instructions
- Provide clear comments explaining vector database concepts
- Use realistic datasets and scenarios
- Include error handling for educational examples

## Target Audience

- **Beginners** - No prior vector database experience required
- **Intermediate Developers** - Comfortable with Python and basic ML concepts
- **Advanced Practitioners** - Seeking production-ready implementation patterns

The learning path is designed to take someone from zero knowledge to production-capable vector database implementation through progressive, hands-on exercises.
